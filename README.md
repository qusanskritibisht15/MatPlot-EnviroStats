# MatPlot-EnviroStats
This project analyzes environmental and economic data using Python. It categorizes income, expenditure, and market value into groups to assess trends. Visualizations show income levels, expenditure patterns, and environmental value across states and years. Overall, it highlights the link between income, expenditure, and environmental value.

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing key environmental indicators using Python. The dataset contains variables related to employment, income groups, environmental metrics, and other socio-economic factors. Using Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for visual representation, this project uncovers hidden trends, compares categories, and highlights meaningful patterns within the environmental dataset.

**Dataset**

File: environment_data.csv

Url: 

**Main Features Include:**
•	Employment
•	Income group
•	Environmental indicators
•	Other socio-economic parameters
The data was cleaned, processed, and categorized to support better interpretation and visualization.

**Objectives**

•	Explore relationships between environmental and socio-economic variables
•	Clean and preprocess the dataset for accurate visualization
•	Categorize income groups and create clear comparative plots
•	Use Matplotlib to graphically present insights and trends
________________________________________
**Libraries Used**

•	NumPy
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn (optional)

**Approach**

1. Data Loading & Cleaning
•	Loaded the CSV file using Pandas
•	Renamed incorrect column names (e.g., emplyoment → employment)
•	Created a new column classifying regions by income group
•	Handled missing values where needed
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Summary statistics
•	Distribution analysis
•	Group comparisons
•	Identification of unusual or extreme values
3. Visualizations
Multiple visualizations were created using Matplotlib, such as:
•	Bar charts (Income group vs. employment)
•	Line trends (Environmental indicators over time)
•	Category comparisons
•	Histograms and distribution plots
These visuals help translate raw data into meaningful, easy-to-understand insights.
________________________________________
**Results**

•	Employment patterns vary significantly across different income groups.
•	Visualizations highlight how socio-economic and environmental factors interact.
•	Data patterns become clearer through properly cleaned and structured plots.
•	The project demonstrates how environmental datasets can be interpreted using Python-based visualization.

**Conclusion**

This project provides a simple yet effective demonstration of environmental data analysis using Python. Through preprocessing, categorization, and Matplotlib-driven visualization, it translates raw data into actionable insights. The workflow serves as a foundation for further statistical analysis, machine learning models, or policy-based research.
